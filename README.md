# Coordinate Obfuscator
This plugin obfuscates the world coordinates. Basically, the
coordinates that a player sees is fake and randomised. This means
that players cannot trust on coordinates to find eachother.

It does so by offsetting the coordinate system of every player by a random amount everytime they log in.

This is an upgraded version of the plugin [CoordinatesObfuscator](https://github.com/cavallium/CoordinatesObfuscator)

Currently only works on 1.21 paper

## Requirements
[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) 5.3.0 or higher
